# 246 Club : Lending Restaking Primitive

Many lending markets have emerged within the DeFi ecosystem, each offering distinct mechanisms and tradeoffs ranging from minor interest rate variations to major divergences in protocol design. As user needs become more specialized, infrastructures have adapted to facilitate increasingly granular markets.

In this context, 246Club proposes a unified system that enables users to consolidate and optimize borrowing and lending conditions across numerous specialized protocols, thereby creating an experience akin to operating within a single lending platform. Central to our framework are Cross-Protocol Loan positions, which unlock Cross-Protocol Arbitrage by allowing borrowers to combine favorable conditions from multiple sources undergoing progressive specialization and differentiation.

A cornerstone of this architecture is Credit Stripping, a technique that decouples collateral deposits from the borrowing process. By permitting collateral to reside in one protocol while securing loans from another, users can form atomic positions where interest rate arbitrage becomes both practical and efficient.

Furthermore, Lending Restaking underpins our system by enabling existing protocol lenders to re-stake their positions for additional arbitrage capture. Inspired by EigenLayer, this mechanism imposes no extra marginal cost or market fragmentation; lenders maintain their original yield and liquidity while voluntarily assuming heightened risk within the same vertical to attain higher returns.
Through these innovations, 246Club aims to streamline access to specialized DeFi lending markets, preserve capital efficiency, and enhance lenders and borrowers’ ability to exploit and capture interest rate disparities—all within a cohesive and unified layer.
